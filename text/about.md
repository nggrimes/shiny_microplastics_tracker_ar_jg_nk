## Overview of the Plastics Estimator Shiny App

The goal of this project is to understand how plastic pollution in our oceans is related to coastal city populations. The app provides the following features:

- Interactive U.S. map showing plastic data near coastal cities. The map also shows city population data.
- A plastic debris estimator that calculates plastic debris based on city population.
- Trend analysis of pollution data over time

### How to Use the App

1. Select the year and season to view relevant data.
2. Choose the type of plastic you wish to explore (microplastic or macroplastic).
3. View city population data and see its correlation with plastic debris.
4. Use the plastic debris estimator to calculate plastic pollution in your city.
5. Analyze pollution trends over time to observe changes.

### Data Sources

This app uses data from global and local pollution reports and population statistics
