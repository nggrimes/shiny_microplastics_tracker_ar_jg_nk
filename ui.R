# Goal: Understand how microplastics in our oceans are related to coastal city populations

# Widget 1: Interactive World map: Users will see a world map with microplastic data for different spots in the oceans near coastal cities. 
## Users will be able to click on those spots and see exact data for how much plastic is in that area. 
## The map will have some filters that include year and season, etc.. 
# ---
### Map: World Map, data points for coastal cities (small dots in blue) & microplastic data (size=microplastic #, opaque, colored red)
### Data Overlay: Click on a city & see the plastic data there (sampling method, density range & class, org, date sampled)
### Filters: Data filters that refresh the page (year, season, type of plastic, anything else we can include from the plastics data)


# Widget 2: Interactive world map: Users will see a world map with  population of coastal cities. (can all be integrated above into one city DB)
## Users will be able to click on those cities to see exact #s for the population of those cities. 
## Map will have some filters like year, season, and density, etc
# ---
### Filter: Hide/show population data


# Widget 3: A calculator estimate based on averages from the first two widgets (plastic debris + coastal city population info) 
## where a user will be able to put in their coastal town/city #s and season/year and get an estimate of how much plastic was present or is present in the surrounding oceans
# ---
### Calculator: User inputs city, year, season
### Calculator can re-create model using data currently shown in the map, and filter out those that aren't being utilized currently
### Calculator spits out LM (LR, RF?) with predictive data on estimate of plastic debris in the ocean  
#### when buffering, turn miles into lat&long and group -> https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/2951/algorithm-for-offsetting-a-latitude-longitude-by-some-amount-of-meters

# Widget 4: allows you to graphically see trends in pollution over time by using drop downs that let you change the graph by location and time range
## This will be a line graph that shows the amount of plastic in the ocean over time for a specific location
# ---
### User inputs location & time range
### Graph: Line graph, x-axis = time, y-axis = plastic debris
